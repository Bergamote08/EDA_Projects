### EDA_Project_Tinder

The goal of this project is for the marketing team of Tinder what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together.

The data was collected during a speed meeting experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of informations about themselves that could ultimately reflect on ther dating profile on the app.
During the speed meeting events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

To understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together we tried to answer different questions :

- What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners?
- How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection vs. its real impact?
- Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?
- Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?
- In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?
