# Big Data_Projet_Steam

The Goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. But we are taking advantage of this opportunity to analyze the video game market globally.

We are analyzing at a "macro" level, and also by genre, by platforms trying to answer some of these questions : 

Which publisher has released the most games on Steam?

What are the best rated games?

Are there years with more releases? Were there more or fewer game releases during the Covid, for example?

What are the most represented languages?

Are there many games prohibited for children under 16/18?

What are the most represented genres?

What are the most lucrative genres?

Are most games available on Windows/Mac/Linux instead?
